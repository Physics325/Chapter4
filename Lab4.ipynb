    "# Lab 4 - Additional ODEs\n",
    "We'll look into more ODEs that can be solved using our techniques. These are problems from Chapter 4 and some will likely be for homework. Use the lab time to begin working on them in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Problem 4-5, multi-element radioactive decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Problem 4-8, driven spring-mass system. Note the plot is amplitude vs drive frequency $\\omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Problem 4-9, finite resources. Many models in finance, resource management, and economics follow a set of DEs. Use our tools to explore a model of oil based on extraction, price, and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Problem 4-6 (if you have time).\n"
